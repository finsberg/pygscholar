# Installation

Since this package is primarily a command line tool it is recommended to install it with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
```
pipx install pygscholar
```

You can of course also install it with pip
```
python -m pip install pygscholar
```

or alternatively you can install it directly from Github
```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/finsberg/pygscholar
```
